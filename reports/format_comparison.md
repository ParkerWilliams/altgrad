# ANAL-01: FP8 Format Comparison Report

**Generated:** 2026-01-22 20:23:53
**Status:** Pending Experiments

## Executive Summary

This report will compare FP8 format performance across training experiments,
analyzing convergence quality, stability metrics, and completion rates.

**Sweet-spot format:** Pending - experiments not yet run

## Pending Experiments

The following experiments need to be run to generate this report:

| Format | Config File | Purpose |
|--------|-------------|---------|
| BF16 | experiments/configs/bf16_baseline.yaml | Baseline (no quantization) |
| E5M2 | experiments/configs/e5m2_short.yaml | IEEE FP8 standard format |
| E3M4 | experiments/configs/e3m4_uniform.yaml | Balanced exponent/mantissa |
| E1M6 | experiments/configs/e1m6_uniform.yaml | High precision, low range |
| E0M7 | experiments/configs/e0m7_uniform.yaml | Fixed-point (no exponent) |
| E7M0 | experiments/configs/e7m0_uniform.yaml | Maximum range, no precision |

## How to Run Experiments

```bash
# Run all format comparison experiments
python experiments/run_experiment.py experiments/configs/bf16_baseline.yaml
python experiments/run_experiment.py experiments/configs/e5m2_short.yaml
python experiments/run_experiment.py experiments/configs/e3m4_uniform.yaml
python experiments/run_experiment.py experiments/configs/e1m6_uniform.yaml
python experiments/run_experiment.py experiments/configs/e0m7_uniform.yaml
python experiments/run_experiment.py experiments/configs/e7m0_uniform.yaml

# After experiments complete, regenerate reports
python scripts/generate_reports.py --project <your-wandb-project>
```

## Expected Sections (after experiments)

1. Format Rankings by Loss
2. Format Rankings by Stability
3. Completion Rates by Format
4. Detailed Format Statistics
5. Improvement vs Baseline
6. Conclusions

## W&B Integration

Reports will be linked to W&B runs for full traceability once experiments are run.
