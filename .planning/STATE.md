Recent decisions affecting current work:

- None yet

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

**High-risk experiments:**
- E7M0 has >90% probability of training failure (expected negative result)
- E0M7 narrow dynamic range may cause overflow on unnormalized tensors

**Budget constraint:**
- Single H100, $20 total compute limits experiment iterations
- Short runs only - convergence trends, not full training
